Implementation of a C library for an external RAM for the Arduino Uno.

## Timer Overhead

The program ```test_timer.cpp``` tries to find the overhead caused by the time measurement implemented in ```lib_time```. If one plugs in $100$ s in the ```_delay_ms()``` function from ```util/delay.h```, then we measure the following times with the ```lib_time``` library for counting milliseconds and decimilliseconds respectively.

| OCR1A  | precision | measured time for 100s | overhead |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| $1999$ | $1$ ms    | $100382$ ms            | $0.38\%$ |
| $199$  | $0.1$ ms  | $103963.6$ ms          | $3.96\%$ |

One could set ```OCR1A``` a little bit lower to compensate the overhead, but this might depend on compiler option which is why we will just leave it at $1999$. In this case the overhead was only about $0.38\%$ which we usually will not even notice as our timer is only counting full milliseconds.
